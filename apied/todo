  move model stuff into adapters (ie a sequel adapter), modify with before/after filters (like middleware)
  integrate schema stuff

? sample generation
  ? define code blocks which say what to do and/or what to output
  ? fixtures

conditional/internal things, ie a nodoc flag where things are checked but not documented and/or in client
  ? perhaps determine based on whether validation/accepts are private/public

versioning
  ? purposefully introduce increasingly large latency as time since deprecation increases

? change to use Endpoint::Base which inherits from Sinatra::Base
  ? eases adoption, but requires changing dsl to accomodate

? what about approaching this from a model perspective and generating routes
